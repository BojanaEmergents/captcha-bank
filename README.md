# Captcha Bank
Solve reCAPTCHAs from any site and store the g-recaptcha-response tokens.

# Prelude
Okay, it's currently 7:05 am and after getting 2 hours of sleep I'm going to attempt to make a captcha harvester myself.
Not a big fan of the word harvester, mainly because I'm hardly awake and it's hard to type in my current state,
so my version will be called "Captcha Bank". If this works then I'll be making it open source.

# Usage
Just clone the project (or download the zip) and run main.go as an Administrator.

Tested on Windows 10, should work on Darwin and Linux but again sudo will most likely be required.
